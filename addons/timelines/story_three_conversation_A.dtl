Bzzz! How...bzz..dy, human! My name is Billy 'Cyborgious" Grainsoldolf and I'm a cyborg wizard from the future here to gather some grain from you. I need to take it...back to the future!
There's a grain war that has left cyborg-kind and wizard-kind completely without grain and I have been sent to gather grain and witness the man that caused the event that caused this.
The replacing of a super qualified grains marketer.
Only time will tell if it was the right thing corporate..I mean whoever decided this, should have done and if they will ever see the error of their ways.
Anyway...let's get some grain!!!
- Finish it!
