It was me ALL along! I 've been trying to run you out of town...
But the only thing that's left town is my wallet because of how much grain I've been buying
I guess I should have started by doing this from the get go...
Please Please PLEASE can I have my job back??? 
- Yeah, sure!
	Yeeeeehaaaaaah!!!! This means the whole wide world to me, partner! I don't think I can ever repay you! I wish you the best in whatever you do after here! Bye!
- Nope, sorry!
	Shoot! I thought that would work! Well that's fine. Atleast I tried. \
Well I wish you the best in your new grain marketing career. You're gonna do great buddy! I know it. Bye! (Runs off crying)
