Alright! It's day one as the CEO and it's time to get to work. Look's like you've got your first customer!

HOOOWW-ahem...I mean Greetings, fellow earthling. It is I, Billy the Astronaut, here to purchase some of your earthly grain!
Why I never...My name is NOT Billy Grainsby. I've never heard of such a man in my entire astonaut career. I'm just here to gather some of you grainiest grainlings to take with me on my next trip to Mars.
Does that seem to be a problem to you, mister? Do I need to get NASA involved?...Good! I'll take some ASAP. Give me your best batch.
- Let's go!
